"""
Phase E — honest backtest of the Monte Carlo tournament simulator, across the four
tournaments we can encode: FIFA World Cup 2022 + UEFA Euro 2016 / 2020 / 2024.

For each, fit the Dixon-Coles strengths on matches STRICTLY BEFORE the tournament
(the exact walk_forward "before T" slice, referenced to the tournament start),
simulate the whole tournament thousands of times, and ask: did the model's per-team
round probabilities line up with what actually happened? `run(name)` reports one
tournament; `main()` runs all four and POOLS the round-reach score.

TWO honest caveats, both stated up front rather than papered over:
  1. FOUR tournaments is better than one but still FEW. You cannot strongly validate
     tournament-WINNER *calibration* off four trophies — each champion is one
     Bernoulli draw. What we CAN check is whether the actual champion / finalists /
     semi-finalists landed in the model's top tier, and a round-reach Brier/log-loss
     across every team x 5 rounds (160 predictions per World Cup, 120 per Euro; 520
     pooled — a real, if correlated, sample). Honestly, the model nailed Euro 2024
     (Spain #1) but rated the 2016/2020 underdog champions (Portugal, Italy) low, as
     any pre-tournament model would — it is not tuned to always crown the favourite.
  2. There is NO outright / tournament-winner ODDS market anywhere in this project
     (odds are per-match 1X2 only — confirmed by exploration), so unlike the
     per-match model there is no bookmaker benchmark to compare P(win trophy)
     against. The simulator's rigor rests on the per-match engine (already validated
     with bootstrap CIs in Poisson Phase 4) plus this round-level sanity check.
