"""
Hand-encoded tournament STRUCTURE — the one thing the Monte Carlo simulator needs
that is not in the data.

The `matches` table stores only date / teams / scores / tournament / neutral. It has
NO column for stage, group, or bracket position, and penalty-shootout knockouts are
stored as draws with no winner. So to simulate a whole tournament we must supply its
structure (which teams are in which group, and how the knockout bracket is wired)
ourselves. That structure is checked in as SOURCE data (e.g. wc2022.json), small and
cross-checkable against Wikipedia — unlike the regenerable derived DB, it IS
committed.

This module loads such a config and validates it: the counts are internally
consistent, and (given a fitted `strengths` dict from poisson.fit_dixon_coles) every
team name resolves to a real fitted strength — failing LOUDLY on any miss, so a
typo'd or renamed team can never silently become a league-average phantom.

# Euro 24-team format: the "best third-placed teams" knockout wiring
# ===========================================================================
# In the 24-team Euro format (2016, 2020, 2024) the six group winners (1A-1F) and
# six runners-up (2A-2F) advance, PLUS the four best of the six third-placed teams.
# Four group winners host a third-placed team in the Round of 16; WHICH group's third
# each faces is fixed by the SET of the four groups whose thirds qualified — UEFA's
# published anti-rematch table (a group's winner is never paired with its own group's
# third). There are C(6,4)=15 possible sets.
#
# The bracket layout is NOT the same across editions: Euro 2020 and 2024 share one
# layout (winners 1B/1C/1E/1F host the thirds), but Euro 2016 used a different one
# (winners 1A/1B/1C/1D). So the table lives IN each config next to its bracket, not
# as a shared constant. A euro24 config therefore carries two extra fields:
#   "third_slots"  : the ordered labels of the four best-third R16 slots, e.g.
#                    ["3vB","3vC","3vE","3vF"] — "3vB" is the third that plays the
#                    winner of group B, so its own host group is the letter after "3v".
#   "thirds_table" : {four-group combo -> [group filling each third-slot, positional
#                    to "third_slots"]}, one row per the 15 combos. Cross-checkable
#                    against Wikipedia's "Combinations of matches in the round of 16"
#                    (Tomas's manual-verification domain); validated on load by
#                    _validate_euro24_thirds below (bijection + no same-group rematch).
